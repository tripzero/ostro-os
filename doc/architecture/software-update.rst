Software Update Mechanism for Ostro |trade| OS
##############################################

Introduction
============

Ostro OS based software can be deployed to a target device in two ways:

- Full Disk Flashing

  A new software image is built and installed, completely replacing
  what was previously present on the device.
  It can be useful for initializing a device with Ostro OS.

- Software Update

  This is a component that Ostro OS borrows from Clear Linux\* OS
  for Intel |reg| Architecture and consists of both a server and client
  component.


Software Update Server
======================

The software update server runs for example,
on a CI (Continuous Integration) server and not on the device itself.
For each build, the server generates information specific to that build
(in software update lingo, the delta from version 0) and related to
previous builds (deltas from a customizable number of previous versions).

The information produced by the server is then provided by an HTTP server
and consumed by the software update client running on supported devices.

Update information is secured by generating hashes of each file and then
signing the file containing the references to the hashes.
A secure channel is not required to distribute the updates.
As long as the signature and integrity checks are satisfied, the software
update client will treat them as trusted.


Software Update Client
======================

The client runs on the device and is responsible of downloading, verifying
and applying the updates.
It can also restore modified files to their pristine state as then were in the
initial sw image.


SW Bundles
==========

The software update mechanism supports the concept of bundles_: groups of files
that provide one functionality.
It is similar to the concept of a package used in the vast majority of Linux distros,
but in general one software update bundle maps to several packages (ex: .rpm or .deb)

There is one main os-core bundle containing everything that is mandatory for having
a bare-bones working system.
Everything else is optional and can be either deployed or removed by using the
software update client program.

Ostro OS developers can also use bundles by following the rule that each application is
contained in its own bundle.
